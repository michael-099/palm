Introduction
Stroke is one of the most common causes of death and is the main cause of persistent and acquired disability in adults worldwide Considering demographic changes a further increase in stroke rates is expected Moreover stroke is expected to increasingly affect younger patients The World Health Organization refers to stroke as the incoming epidemic of the 21st century Therefore currently strategies for stroke prevention are of prime importance particularly with regard to the recent studies suggesting that 85 of all strokes may be preventable 1 Lifestyle modification is of particular interest for stroke prevention as the incidence of stroke has decreased by up to 42 in developed countries within the last 30 years whereas an increase by more than 100 has been reported in developing countries 2 This observation indicates the important role of lifestyle and diet the prevalence of risk factors such as smoking hyperlipidemia or high blood pressure has decreased considerably thereby increasing awareness among the populations of highincome countries However in lowincome countries industrialization has led to unfavorable food and lifestyle changes 2 This review aims to discuss effective lifestyle modifications and medical interventions for optimal stroke prevention An overview of the evidence for the recommendations is shown in table 1

Medical Measures
Arterial Hypertension
Hypertension is the most important and modifiable risk factor for stroke Uncontrolled hypertension is also a main cause of cognitive deficits and dementia A reduction of systolic blood pressure SBP by 2 mm Hg was associated with stroke reduction by 25 while reduction in diastolic blood pressure DBP led to stroke reduction by 50 3 The relationship between blood pressure and stroke risk is linear and continuous as the reduction of borderline hypertension SBP 130140 mm Hg and DBP 8589 mm Hg was also associated with risk reduction of stroke Treatment of isolated SBP in elderly patients is also preventive reduction of SBP 160 mm Hg to 145 mm Hg in patients aged 80 years was associated with stroke reduction by 30 within 2 years 4

Efficacious reduction of blood pressure is much more important and essential for stroke prevention than the choice of antihypertensive drugs The selection of drug class should be made based on comorbidities Some studies and metaanalyses suggest a beneficial trend in favor of calcium antagonists and angiotensinconverting enzyme blockers 5 whereas beta blockers in hypertensive patients without heart disease seem to be less protective for stroke prevention Recent studies indicate that a high variability in blood pressure is associated with a higher stroke risk which again supports treatment with calcium antagonists 6 Furthermore patients with metabolic risk factors who are treated with thiazide diuretics or beta blockers seem to have a higher risk for the new onset of diabetes mellitus 7

Indications for the use of antihypertensive drugs depend on blood pressure values and the vascular risk profile thus treatment should be initiated earlier in patients with diabetes mellitus or in those with a high vascular risk profile In patients with a low risk profile and borderline blood pressure values nonpharmaceutical treatment options should be used eg lowsalt diet physical activity or weight reduction Antihypertensive drug treatment is recommended for all patients with blood pressure 14090 mm Hg whereas the treatment goal in highrisk patients should be ideally blood pressure levels of 13080 mm Hg

Dyslipidemia and Statins
The association between stroke and hypercholesterinemia is less clear although it is an established risk factor for myocardial infarction Many studies indicate an increased risk of ischemic stroke with higher serum cholesterol levels 7 mmoll whereas lower cholesterol levels in patients with hypertension SBP 145 mm Hg tend to be associated with hemorrhagic stroke Hypercholesterinemia is clearly related to carotid atherosclerosis 8 whereas HDLcholesterol is inversely associated with the risk of ischemic stroke Statins have been shown to prevent stroke markedly in patients with coronary heart disease diabetes mellitus or carotid stenosis whereas this was not the case for the use of fibrates The action of statins is assumed to be mediated through pleiotropic effects antiinflammatory immunomodulatory plaque stabilizer vasodilatation 9 While the use of statins is clearly indicated for secondary prevention after ischemic stroke due to artery atheromatosis it is controversial whether statins may reduce stroke risk in the healthy population without vascular disease 10 The absolute risk reduction for healthy people seems to be rather low 02 per year and so the use of statins in general cannot be recommended

Diabetes Mellitus
Patients with diabetes mellitus have a higher risk of vascular events According to a prospective observational study patients with type 2 diabetes suffered more frequently from stroke than from myocardial infarction 11 Diabetes promotes cerebral microangiopathy and causes lacunar type strokes Current data indicate that metformin may be beneficial for stroke prevention in diabetes 12 Intense control of hyperglycemia rather reduces microvascular complications whereas the effect on macrovascular complications such as stroke is not clear 13 Moreover intense control of present vascular risk factors such as hypertension or dyslipidemia has been shown to efficiently reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in diabetic patients 14 In addition the use of statins has been shown to significantly reduce stroke risk by 21 for each 1 mmoll decrease in LDLcholesterol

Carotid Stenosis
The prevalence of asymptomatic carotid stenosis 50 increases with age and in patients with coronary heart disease smoking and diabetes mellitus On the other hand patients with carotid stenosis have a 4fold higher risk of myocardial infarction than stroke 15 While endarterectomy of symptomatic carotid stenosis is a proven and beneficial treatment for secondary stroke prevention its value for asymptomatic stenosis remains controversial Randomized trials from the nineties have suggested a benefit for surgery in asymptomatic carotid stenosis of ≥60 to ≥70 relative risk reduction by 50 provided the perioperative complication risk is less than 3 and patients have a life expectancy ≥5 years 1617 Considering the absolute risk reduction of 1 per year however the treatment effect was rather low Moreover recent studies suggested a stroke risk of 1 per year for patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis and treated with intensive medical therapy which was primarily attributed to regular use of antihypertensive drugs and statins and lifestyle modification This new observation questions the value of surgery in asymptomatic patients 18 Therefore current randomized studies such as SPACE2 are investigating the absolute benefit of asymptomatic carotid stenosis Percutaneous intervention by stenting is considered a justifiable alternative to surgery in symptomatic carotid stenosis especially in patients younger than 70 years Considering asymptomatic stenosis the current body of evidence is insufficient for recommending stents as standard therapy

Intracranial Stenosis
Currentdata recommend an aggressive medical treatment of intracranial stenosis as angioplasty and stenting in symptomatic patients was clearly associated with a higher risk of adverse outcomes 19 Anticoagulation caused higher rates of intracranial hemorrhages than antiplatelet agents and was not superior in preventing a secondary ischemic stroke 20

Atrial Fibrillation
The prevalence of atrial fibrillation increases with age 1 in 60yearold patients 18 in patients aged 85 years It is the leading cause of stroke in the elderly and is associated with large infarcts and high mortality rates A regular pulse palpation in patients aged 65 years and electrocardiography in the case of arrhythmic heart rate is recommended by cardiology societies to detect atrial fibrillation and prevent ischemic stroke 21 The decision for anticoagulation in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is made according to the CHA2 DS2VASc score 21 As compared to the former CHADS2score the new score places more emphasis on age gender and vascular comorbidities of patients and recommends anticoagulation at a score ≥1 points except for women without any other risk factors Furthermore the specificity in defining lowrisk patients has also increased thus no more aspirin is recommended for this group score  0 points In general aspirin is less effective for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation Anticoagulation reduces the stroke risk by 70 in atrial fibrillation and the benefit of treatment in older patients with atrial fibrillation by far outweighs the bleeding risk which can be estimated by HASBLED Score 2223 However studies indicate an underuse of anticoagulants due to physicians perception on the risk of major bleeding as excessively high because of the presence of clinical risk factors such as falls It has been calculated that the risk of subdural hematoma that happens as a result of falling is so small that persons with an average stroke risk of 5 per year must fall approximately 300 times in a year for the risks of anticoagulation to outweigh its benefits 24 As compared to vitamin Kantagonists the new anticoagulants thrombin inhibitor factor Xaantagonist have the main advantages of easier usage and a higher safety profile particularly a lower risk of intracranial hemorrhage On the other hand the new oral anticoagulants may have the following disadvantages as compared with vitamin Kantagonists short duration of action leading to increased stroke risk in case of poor compliance lack of monitoring and antidote in case of emergent surgery or bleeding and higher costs

Patent Foramen Ovale
The best treatment for patent foramen ovale PFO in cryptogenic stroke is still under debate Closure of PFO with Amplatzer devices seems reasonable in younger patients without vascular risk factors whereas PFO in older stroke patients with vascular comorbidities is probably incidental and thus do not necessarily need a closure 2526 The best medical treatment for PFO antiplatelet vs anticoagulant is the subject of ongoing studies

Sleep Disordered Breathing
Sleep disordered breathing SDB has been increasingly recognized as an independent risk factor for stroke 2728 SDB can be the cause and the consequence of stroke 2930 The high frequency 5070 of SDB in stroke patients often in the form of obstructive sleep apnea OSA justifies the routine implementation of screening tools such as respiratory polygraph or apnea check In severe OSA treatment with continuous positive airway pressure CPAP may reduce the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality whereas the evidence for efficient stroke prevention is still limited 3132

Antithrombotics
For primary stroke prevention acetylsalicylic acid aspirin has been the most investigated antithrombotic drug The Womens Health Study reported a stroke reduction by 17 in healthy women taking 100 mg aspirin every 2 days as compared to placebo however the difference was statistically non significant 33 In the Physicians Health Study no stroke prevention was observed in men treated with aspirin 34 A recent metaanalysis including 95000 participants found no association between aspirin and primary stroke prevention in either women or men whereas the rates of gastrointestinal bleeding were significantly increased in the aspirin arm 35 Current data do not support a general use of aspirin for stroke prevention in the healthy population or in patients with diabetes mellitus 36 On the other hand antithrombotics including aspirin clopidrogel and dipyridamol are clearly indicated for secondary stroke prevention in patients with ischemic stroke relative risk reduction by 2025

Lifestyle Modification
Salt
The average salt intake in most Western countries is close to 10 g a day and much higher in many Eastern European and Asian countries whereas international recommendations suggest that average population salt intake should be less than 56 g per day 37 Intake of higher salt amounts is associated with higher risk for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke 37 About 20 of all intracerebral hemorrhages are assumed to result from adding salt to food 38 Moreover reduction of dietary salt intake by half a teaspoon was associated with a reduction of cardiovascular events by 20 39 The risk is assumed to result from increased blood pressure leading to fibrosis in the arteries kidneys and heart 40 Reduction of dietary salt intake by a teaspoon equal to 56 g salt has been shown to reduce systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 7 and 4 mm Hg respectively in hypertensive patients whereas blood pressure reduction in patients with resistant hypertension was much higher systolic by 23 mm Hg and diastolic by 9 mm Hg respectively 4142 Of note many people consume prepared foods which contain a lot of salt and this makes control of salt intake difficult

Smoking
Cigarette smoking is an independent risk factor for stroke and potentiates the effect of other risk factors such as hypertension or hormone replacement therapy The mechanism is due to reduced endogenous fibrinolysis and increased thrombocyte activity Recent studies also suggest an association between passive smoking and stroke Stroke risk was reduced by 50 one year after quitting smoking and was comparable to that of nonsmokers 5 years later

Physical Activity
Regular physical activity decreases stroke risk by 2530 through favorable effects on other vascular risk factors such as hypertension hyperlipidemia and overweight The doseeffect relation is controversial however thus it is not clear whether maximal physical activity leads also to maximal stroke reduction

Overweight
Each unit increase in body mass index BMI has been suggested to increase stroke risk by 5 However stroke mortality is also increased in underweight patients Markers of abdominal obesity such as waisttohip ratio or waist circumference are reported to correlate better with stroke risk While obesity is an established risk factor for stroke occurrence recent studies report decreased mortality risk in obese stroke patients as compared to normal weight patients ‘obesity paradox To date however randomized trials on risk modification by weight reduction are lacking

Alcohol
The association between alcohol consumption and stroke risk is Jshaped while slight to moderate alcohol intake ≤2 drinks per day for men and ≤1 drink per day for women respectively may reduce stroke risk by 30 higher consumption significantly increases the risk of stroke

Vitamins
There is robust evidence from many randomized trials that supplementation with vitamins A C E or betacarotene does not reduce the risk of stroke Moreover increased mortality rates have been observed for regular substitution with betacarotene and vitamins A and E Although hyperhomocysteinemia is a known risk factor for stroke and serum levels of homocysteine can be lowered by treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 randomized trials did not prove stroke prevention by regular folate supplementation 43 Vitamin B3 niacin was reported to reduce stroke risk in former studies while statins were not used regularly Supplementation with niacin increased HDLcholesterol levels in patients treated with statins but did not reduce stroke rates 44

Potassium
Several observational studies and a metaanalysis have indicated that a higher potassium intake is associated with a reduction of stroke risk by 21 relative risk 079 95 CI 060090 45 The effect seems to be dosedependent every increase in potassium intake by 1 g per day resulted in a reduction of stroke risk by 11 46 The mechanism is probably partially mediated by the reduction of blood pressure 47

Calcium
Randomized trials have shown that calcium supplementation of 500 mg per day was associated with a significant risk for myocardial infarction and a trend toward an increase in stroke 48 A metaanalysis of 3 placebocontrolled trials including 20000 patients showed similar results for the combined supplementation of calcium and vitamin D 49

Fats
Current studies indicate no significant association between stroke risk and the amount of fat intake fat origin animal vs vegetable and types of fats saturated vs polyunsaturated 5051 Consumption of industrially produced trans fats or saturated fatty acids however have been shown to increase the risk of coronary heart disease 5253 Although marinederived omega3 polyunsaturated fatty acids from oily fish such as salmon or herring have been reported to significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular deaths in several randomized trials no significant effect on stroke prevention has been demonstrated to date 5455 On the other hand the consumption of plantderived omega3 polyunsaturated fatty acids from vegetable oils such as walnut flaxseed or soybean has been reported to decrease stroke risk according to an observational study although this needs to be confirmed in randomized trials 56

Protein and Carbohydrates
The amount of protein intake and protein type animal vs vegetable does not seem to be a risk factor for stroke 57 Consumption of foods and liquids with added sugars and high dietary glycemic indices increases the risk for overweight diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease 58 Increased stroke mortality was reported among the Japanese people with high carbohydrate intake 59

Foods and Beverages
Regular fish consumption was associated with a reduced stroke risk as reported by several observational studies 60 whereas daily meat consumption is shown to increase the risk of stroke 61 Increased intake of fruits and vegetables 5 servings per day significantly reduce the stroke risk whereas vegetable intake alone did not prevent strokes 162 The mechanism is not clearly known although reduction of blood pressure is thought to play an important role A recent study reported that high plasma levels of lyocopene eg found in tomatoes were associated with a reduced risk of stroke by 50 63 Moderate consumption 34 cups of coffee or tea has been shown to reduce stroke risk as compared with no consumption 6465 The mechanism may be due to their antioxidative effects and improved endothelial function Chocolate consumption was also associated with lower rate of stroke and cardiovascular disease possibly mediated by the antiinflammatory and antithrombotic effects of cocoa 66 Finally the Mediterranean diet has recently been reported to reduce stroke risk 67

Global Lifestyle Modification
Global modification of lifestyle has been shown to be more beneficial than the treatment of single risk factors Patients fulfilling all 5 criteria of lowrisk lifestyle no smoking regular physical activity ≥30 min per day healthy nutrition moderate alcohol consumption BMI 25 kgm2 had a reduced stroke risk by 80 as compared to patients fulfilling none of these criteria 68

Conclusions
In summary stroke risk can be substantially reduced using the medical measures proven in many randomized trials Arterial hypertension is by far the most important risk factor for stroke whereas treatment of dyslipidemia with statins will further reduce the stroke risk Anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation and carotid endarterectomy in symptomatic highgrade carotid stenosis are also very efficient in stroke prevention whereas the general use of aspirin statins or vitamins cannot be recommended for healthy people Observational data strongly indicate that lifestyle modifications such as healthy diet cessation of smoking and alcohol overuse regular physical activity and achievement of normal body weight are beneficial for stroke prevention However one should consider that most lifestyle recommendations rely on casecontrol and epidemiological studies which may be hampered by bias The main challenge will be to educate and convince the population on the benefits that can be expected from healthy lifestyle and nutrition as smoking and some dietary habits may rather be considered addictions Therefore structured therapy programs may be warranted in many situations

How to prevent stroke
Here are seven ways to start reining in your risks today to avoid stroke before a stroke has the chance to strike

1 Lower blood pressure
High blood pressure is a huge factor doubling or even quadrupling your stroke risk if it is not controlled High blood pressure is the biggest contributor to the risk of stroke in both men and women Monitoring blood pressure and if it is elevated treating it is probably the biggest difference people can make to their vascular health

Your goal An ideal goal is maintaining a blood pressure of less than 12080 But there may be good reasons why you and your doctor will not want your readings to be this low For some a less aggressive goal such as no higher than 14090 may be more appropriate

How to achieve it

Reduce the salt in your diet to no more than 1500 milligrams a day about a half teaspoon
Avoid highcholesterol foods such as burgers cheese and ice cream
Eat 4 to 5 cups of fruits and vegetables every day one serving of fish two to three times a week and several daily servings of whole grains and lowfat dairy
Get more exercise — at least 30 minutes of activity a day and more if possible
Quit smoking if you smoke
If needed take blood pressure medicines

2 Lose weight
Obesity as well as the complications linked to it including high blood pressure and diabetes raises your odds of having a stroke If youre overweight losing as little as 10 pounds can have a real impact on your stroke risk

Your goal While an ideal body mass index BMI is 25 or less that may not be realistic for you Work with your doctor to create a personal weight loss strategy

How to achieve it

Try to eat no more than 1500 to 2000 calories a day depending on your activity level and your current BMI
Increase the amount of exercise you do with activities like walking golfing or playing tennis and by making activity part of every single day
3 Exercise more
Exercise contributes to losing weight and lowering blood pressure but it also stands on its own as an independent stroke reducer

Your goal Exercise at a moderate intensity at least five days a week

How to achieve it

Take a walk around your neighborhood every morning after breakfast
Start a fitness club with friends
When you exercise reach the level at which youre breathing hard but you can still talk
Take the stairs instead of an elevator when you can
If you dont have 30 consecutive minutes to exercise break it up into 10 to 15minute sessions a few times each day
4 If you drink — do it in moderation
Drinking a little alcohol such as an average of one per day is okay Once you start drinking more than two drinks per day your risk goes up very sharply

Your goal Dont drink alcohol or do it in moderation

How to achieve it

Have no more than one glass of alcohol a day
Consider red wine as your first choice which some studies suggest might help prevent heart disease and stroke
Watch your portion sizes A standardsized drink is a 5ounce glass of wine 12ounce beer or 15ounce glass of hard liquor
5 Treat atrial fibrillation
Atrial fibrillation is a form of irregular heartbeat that causes clots to form in the heart Those clots can then travel to the brain producing a stroke Atrial fibrillation carries almost a fivefold risk of stroke and should be taken seriously

Your goal If you have atrial fibrillation get it treated

How to achieve it

If you have symptoms such as heart palpitations or shortness of breath see your doctor for an exam
You may need to take an anticoagulant drug blood thinner such as one of the directacting anticoagulant drugs to reduce your stroke risk from atrial fibrillation Your doctors can guide you through this treatment
6 Treat diabetes
Having high blood sugar damages blood vessels over time making clots more likely to form inside them

Your goal Keep your blood sugar under control

How to achieve it

Monitor your blood sugar as directed by your doctor
Use diet exercise and medicines to keep your blood sugar within the recommended range
7 Quit smoking
Smoking accelerates clot formation in a couple of different ways It thickens your blood and it increases the amount of plaque buildup in the arteries Along with a healthy diet and regular exercise smoking cessation is one of the most powerful lifestyle changes that will help you reduce your stroke risk significantly

Your goal Quit smoking

How to achieve it

Ask your doctor for advice on the most appropriate way for you to quit
Use quitsmoking aids such as nicotine pills or patches counseling or medicine
Dont give up Most smokers need several tries to quit See each attempt as bringing you one step closer to successfully beating the habit
Stroke is the leading cause of longterm adult disability and the fifth leading cause of death in the US with approximately 795000 stroke events in the US each year1 2 The aging of the population coupled with the reduction in case fatality after stroke is expected to increase the prevalence of stroke by 34 million people between 2012 and 20303 4 While stroke mortality had decreased in the US over the past two decades recent trends in mortality indicate that these decreases may have leveled off and that stroke mortality may even be rising again Reasons for this remain uncertain but could reflect the consequences of the obesity epidemic and associated diabetes The morbidity associated with stroke remains high with costs estimated at 34 billion per year for healthcare services medications and missed days of work3 5 It is likely that estimates of morbidity and cost burden moreover based on studies of clinical stroke and using traditional measures such as physical disability and healthcare costs underestimate the burden of cerebrovascular disease It is increasingly appreciated for example that subclinical cerebrovascular disease—including socalled “silent infarction” identified on brain imaging in up to 28 of the population over age 656 and ischemic white matter disease—is associated with memory loss dementia gait impairment and other functional disability Furthermore the global burden of stroke is high with stroke remaining the fourth leading cause of death worldwide with a particularly large impact in developing nations7 8

Stroke Risk Factors
Unlike myocardial infarction which is almost always due to large vessel atherosclerotic disease affecting the coronary arteries identification of risk factors for stroke is complicated by the fact that strokes come in many varieties At the most basic level stroke is divided into hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes The majority approximately 80 of strokes are ischemic although the relative burden of hemorrhagic versus ischemic stroke varies among different populations Hemorrhagic strokes can be either primarily intraparenchymal or subarachnoid Ischemic stroke can be further divided into what have been referred to as etiologic subtypes or categories thought to represent the causes of the stroke cardioembolic atherosclerotic lacunar other specific causes dissections vasculitis specific genetic disorders others and strokes of unknown cause9 Risk factors for hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke are similar but there are some notable differences there are also differences in risk factors among the etiologic categories of ischemic stroke Hypertension is a particularly important risk factor for hemorrhagic stroke though it contributes to atherosclerotic disease that can lead to ischemic stroke as well Hyperlipidemia on the other hand is a particularly important risk factor for strokes due to atherosclerosis of extracranial and intracranial blood vessels10 just as it is a risk factor for coronary atherosclerosis Atrial fibrillation is a risk factor for cardioembolic stroke

There is evidence that a high proportion of hemorrhagic stroke relative to ischemic stroke can be found in developing countries where the burden of hypertensive disorders is greater As the recognition and treatment of hypertension has improved in those countries often with an increase in Western style diets the proportion of hemorrhagic strokes declines and the proportion of ischemic strokes as well as cardiovascular disease in general increases This pattern of the epidemiologic transition from hypertensive hemorrhagic stroke to ischemic strokes and their associated risk factors has been particularly wellillustrated over a relatively short period of time in studies of stroke in Beijing China during that country’s rapid economic development over recent decades11 From 1984 through 2004 for example the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke declined by 17 annually while the incidence of ischemic stroke increased by 87 The proportion of deaths due to cerebrovascular disease declined moreover and the proportion of ischemic heart disease increased

Reducing the burden of stroke in the population requires identification of modifiable risk factors and demonstration of the efficacy of risk reduction efforts There are numerous risk factors for stroke including both modifiable eg diet comorbid conditions and nonmodifiable risk factors eg age race In addition risk factors may also be thought of as shortterm risks or triggers eg infectious events sepsis stress intermediateterm risk factors eg hypertension hyperlipidemia and longterm risk factors for stroke eg sex race Risk factors for stroke in the young also likely differ from those in older patients

Estimating stroke risk based on an individual’s particular combination of risk factors particularly for a first stroke event is an important component of primary care Patients indicate a preference for knowing their stroke risk12 Investigators have therefore sought to create valid risk scoring systems to identify those patients at greatest risk for stroke with the aim of both modifying these risk factors to reduce the risk of stroke and identifying thresholds of risk that would indicate a role for preventive therapies13 14 The Framingham Stroke Risk Profile FSRP a continuouslyupdated wellknown and widely used score combines stroke predictors such as age systolic blood pressure antihypertensive therapy diabetes cigarette smoking left ventricular hypertrophy by electrocardiogram and the presence of cardiovascular disease coronary heart disease peripheral vascular disease congestive heart failure and can be used to estimate 10 year stroke risk stratified by sex Table 1 1518 Other stroke risk scores have been developed from different sample populations and while these additional scores include many of the same risk factors as the FSRP they add additional metrics such as physical disabilities depression and marital status 1921 Risk prediction scores focused solely on stroke however are likely to have limited utility since patients at risk of stroke are at risk of other cardiovascular events as well and so risk scores that include cardiac events and cardiovascular mortality are likely to be more useful22 Recently the ACCAHA Pooled Cohort 10 year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ASCVD risk estimator was the first to include large amount of data from African Americans allowing it to incorporate race as a predictive variable and making it particularly useful in black communities23

A recent international 22 nation casecontrol study INTERSTROKE found that 10 modifiable risk factors explained 90 of the risk of stroke Table 224 The investigators enrolled 3000 patients with stroke n2337 ischemic n663 hemorrhagic and found that hypertension current smoking waisttohip ratio diet risk score regular physical activity diabetes mellitus binge alcohol consumption psychosocial stress and depression cardiac disease and ratio of apolipoprotein B to A1 were all associated with ischemic stroke risk Risk factors for intracerebral hemorrhage included hypertension smoking waisttohip ratio diet and heavy alcohol consumption Considering the majority of strokes are first strokes within this study these findings further illustrate the importance of primary prevention through the reduction of modifiable risk factors particularly those that confer the greatest risk to reduce the risk of a first stroke event25 While much is known about longterm stroke risk factors such as hypertension diabetes and atherosclerotic disease much less is known about shortterm risk factors or triggers for stroke26

Nonmodifiable risk factors also called risk markers for stroke include age sex raceethnicity and genetics In general stroke is a disease of aging The incidence of stroke increases with age with the incidence doubling for each decade after age 5527 The mean age of incident ischemic stroke in 2005 was 692 years Recent evidence suggests however that the incidence and prevalence of ischemic stroke has been increasing in the 2054 year old age group from 129 in 19931994 to 186 in 200528 In a retrospective analysis of the populationbased Greater CincinnatiNorthern Kentucky cohort the proportion of incident stroke occurring among those aged 2054 years increased at each of three oneyear time intervals from 129 in 19931994 to 133 in 1999 to 186 in 2006 In an analysis of the US Nationwide Inpatient Sample among adults 1444 years ischemic stroke admissions increased annually from 1995200829 In hemorrhagic stroke patients the incidence increases after the age of 4530 Some of the recent increases in incidence among younger persons may reflect changes in diagnostic testing as well leading to greater sensitivity for the detection of stroke among those with minor symptoms

The relationship of sex to stroke risk depends on age At young ages women have as high or higher risk of stroke as men though at older ages the relative risk is slightly higher for men31 The higher stroke risk among women at younger ages likely reflects risks related to pregnancy and the postpartum state as well as other hormonal factors such as use of hormonal contraceptives Overall more strokes occur in women than men due to the longer lifespan of women compared to men27 32 A study performed in 8 different European countries found that the risk of stroke increased by 9 per year in men and 10 per year in women33

There are welldocumented racial disparities in stroke 34 African Americans are at twice the risk of incident stroke when compared to their white counterparts and have higher mortality associated with stroke3444 HispanicLatino Americans also have an increased risk of stroke in some cohorts The disparity in stroke incidence is particularly prominent among younger black adults where the risk for subarachnoid hemorrhage and intracerebral hemorrhage is substantially higher than agematched whites38 40 Furthermore American Indians have an increased incidence of stroke compared to nonHispanic whites45 As illustrated recently by the REGARDS study one reason for the racial disparities could be the higher prevalence of stroke risk factors such as hypertension obesity and diabetes among African Americans4652 However these additional risk factors do not completely explain the increased risk seen in these racialethnic groups53 Black race has been identified as a factor in the relationship between rurality and stroke risk53 54 but this could be attributed to issues with access to healthcare34 55 56 Other factors that may influence racialethnic differences in stroke risk include other social determinants of disease language and nativity5760 The racial disparity in stroke mortality is being driven by the racial disparities in stroke incidence highlighting the importance of stroke prevention interventions aimed at minority groups61 Interestingly the association seen between black race and stroke while strong for incident stroke does not remain for recurrent stroke62 This could be due to stroke risk factors being addressed upon discharge from the primary stroke event

Genetic factors are also known to be nonmodifiable risk factors for stroke with parental history and family history increasing the risk of stroke6365 As is the case with other risk factors for stroke the genetic risks of stroke vary by age sex and race Genetic risk factors and heritability will be more thoroughly discussed in the section on genetics below

Modifiable Risk Factors
The modifiable risk factors are of utmost importance as intervention strategies aimed at reducing these factors can subsequently reduce the risk of stroke Early identification and modification of risk factors is imperative27 Modifiable risk factors can be further divided into medical conditions and behavioral risk factors The role of many “traditional” risk factors in causing stroke such as hypertension diabetes hyperlipidemia and smoking are wellestablished The investigation of novel or “emerging” risk factors remains an area of active research

Hypertension Hypertension is the most important modifiable risk factor for stroke with a strong direct linear and continuous relationship between blood pressure and stroke risk66 67 In INTERSTROKE hypertension was by far the most important stroke risk factor using a definition of hypertension that included both a history of hypertension as well as a blood pressure measurement of 16090 mm Hg the population attributable risk or proportion of strokes in the population attributable to hypertension was 5424 Although this was a casecontrol study and thus measurements of blood pressure were likely confounded by recent stroke the results still imply a major effect of blood pressure on stroke risk and are consistent with other studies The effect of blood pressure was also greater for hemorrhagic than ischemic stroke
Even among those who are not defined as hypertensive the higher the blood pressure the higher the risk of stroke 55 Blood pressure regardless of hypertension status rises with increasing age thereby increasing the lifetime risk of developing hypertension 68 69 Of people who are 65 and older more than twothirds are hypertensive66 Hypertension control has improved due to heightened awareness and treatment options with approximately 50 controlled in 2008 and the prevalence of hypertension in the US has remained at 2970 71 In addition to medication for hypertension control hypertensive patients are encouraged to engage in behavioral lifestyle changes such as diet change and increase physical activity to reduce the impact of hypertension 66 Treatment of hypertension whether through medication or lifestyle changes remains one of the most effective strategies in reducing stroke risk but hypertension remains undertreated in the community

Recent studies have suggested that intraindividual variability in blood pressure measurements or differences in blood pressure measures taken at different points in time within an individual are associated with stroke risk beyond the risk due to elevated mean blood pressure alone For example British investigators using data from 4 randomized controlled trials of patients with hypertension prior stroke or prior transient ischemic attack found that variability in 2–10 blood pressure measures over approximately 2 years is a risk factor for stroke independent of mean blood pressure72 The measure of blood pressure variability may serve as an indication of the absence of cardiovascular homeostasis within the individual These results suggest that blood pressure agents that reduce variability and not just mean blood pressure such as calcium channel blockers may have greater benefits Other studies have not confirmed this association however In the Cardiovascular Health Study CHS for example using a model that also accounted for intraindividual change in blood pressure over time blood pressure variability was not associated with stroke risk though it was associated with cardiac events and allcause mortality73

Diabetes Diabetes is an independent risk factor for stroke with a 2fold increased risk in stroke for diabetic patients and stroke accounts for approximately 20 of deaths in diabetics Prediabetics are also at increased risk of stroke74 75 Approximately 8 of Americans have diabetes with nearly half of Americans over 65 prediabetic76 The duration of diabetes is also associated with increased stroke risk in the Northern Manhattan Study duration of diabetes was associated with ischemic stroke adjusted HR103 per year with diabetes 95 CI102104 Compared to nondiabetic participants those with diabetes for 05 years adjusted HR17 95 CI1127 and 510 years adjusted HR18 95 CI1130 were at increased risk and the risk for those with diabetes for ≥10 years increased markedly adjusted HR32 95 CI244574 Diabetic patients who have a stroke tend to be younger are more likely to be African American and have a higher prevalence of other stroke risk factors The increase in diabetes may explain some of the increase in the risk of stroke in younger populations77 The use of combined behavioral modification and medical therapy in diabetics has been shown to reduce the risk of stroke 78 79 Interestingly glycemic control alone in diabetics does not confer the reduced risk that intensive interventions with behavior modification plus medical intervention confer 80 81
Atrial fibrillation and atrial cardiopathy Atrial fibrillation AF has long been recognized to be a major risk factor for stroke and this has only increased with the aging of the US population Incident stroke related to AF has nearly tripled in the past three decades82 The association between AF and stroke has long been assumed to be due to stasis of blood in the fibrillating left atrium causing thrombus formation and embolization to the brain Recent data however challenge this assumption First there is a poor temporal relationship between AF which may come and go at irregular and infrequent intervals and timing of a stroke onethird of patients do not show evidence of AF until after a stroke despite months of preceding continuous heartrhythm monitoring83 Second other paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias PSVT without fibrillation have also been associated with stroke risk in an analysis of claimsbased data PSVT was associated with a doubling in stroke risk even after adjusting for AF84 Third patients with genetic mutations associated with AF such as in the gene for Natriuretic Peptide Precursor A can have strokes even before the onset of AF85 Furthermore in some settings the atrium may be in electromechanical disassociation such that there is fibrillation of the atrium even when the electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm thus the EKG may not be a perfect indicator of the presence of normal atrial contractility Finally other studies have found associations between markers of atrial dysfunction and embolic stroke even in patients without diagnosed AF suggesting that left atrial thromboembolism can occur in the absence of AF86 Elevated Nterminal probrain natriuretic protein NTproBNP is associated with a doubling of stroke risk in observational cohorts Abnormalities of the electrocardiographic P wave on lead V1 which reflects left atrial contractility is also associated with stroke risk independently of AF8789
These findings suggest the need for an updated model that emphasizes the atrial substrate as well as rhythm 90 Aging and vascular risk factors according to this model lead to an abnormal atrial tissue substrate or “atrial cardiopathy” that causes both AF and thromboembolism Figure 1 AF according to this model may be just another marker of stroke risk associated with left atrial dysfunction90 Once stroke occurs the risk of subsequent atrial fibrillation may be further transiently increased by autonomic derangements and a poststroke inflammatory state90 There is even evidence from tertiary analyses of randomized trials that anticoagulation may be of benefit for ischemic stroke patients with evidence of elevations in NTproBNP who are not known to have AF91 Further trials are planned to test this concept of atrial cardiopathy

Atrial Substrate Model of Thromboembolic Stroke

The model emphasizes the importance of systemic and atrial substrate in explaining the relationship between atrial fibrillation AF and stroke Systemic vascular risk factors produce an abnormal atrial tissue substrate that in turn causes both AF and thromboembolism Once AF develops the dysrhythmia causes atrial structural remodeling worsening atrial tissue substrate and atrial dysfunction and thereby further increasing the risk of thromboembolism Concurrently the systemic risk factors driving this process separately increase stroke risk by driving specific mechanisms of stroke outside the atrium such as largeartery atherosclerosis ventricular systolic dysfunction with reduced ejection fraction and insitu cerebral smallvessel occlusion Once stroke occurs changes in autonomic tone and a poststroke inflammatory state may transiently increase the risk of AF from Kamel H Okin P Elkind MSV Iadecola C Atrial Fibrillation and Mechanisms of Stroke Time for a New Model Stroke 2016473895900

Dyslipidemia The relationship between dyslipidemia and stroke risk is complex with an increased risk for ischemic stroke with increased total cholesterol and a decreased risk for ischemic stroke with elevated HDL cholesterol 9298 Evidence for the influence of triglycerides on stroke risk is conflicting Risk appears to depend on stroke subtype moreover with a stronger association of cholesterol levels with large artery ischemic stroke than other ischemic stroke subtypes 10 Total cholesterol meanwhile is inversely associated with hemorrhagic stroke with hemorrhagic stroke risk increasing as total cholesterol decreases99101 The data on lipids and intracerebral hemorrhage are further complicated by the fact that some observational studies have found no increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhage with statin therapy while some treatment trials have102 While these studies show potentially inconsistent and opposite findings between dyslipidemia and risk of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke in the general patient population the use of statins appears to reduce the risk of total and ischemic stroke with no definite increase in the risk of hemorrhagic stroke103 104 The relatively large reduction in risk of ischemic stroke and other ischemic events with statins moreover outweighs any small increased risk of hemorrhage in most patients Among some patients with stroke however and particularly those with prior hemorrhage small vessel disease or cerebral amyloid angiopathy statins may be associated with an increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhage105 106
Sedentary behavior DietNutrition Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome Physical inactivity is associated with many poor health effects including stroke People who are physically active have a lower risk of stroke and stroke mortality than those who are inactive 107 The relationship between physical activity and stroke may be due to the associated decrease in blood pressure reduction in diabetes and reduction in excess body weight 108
Diet influences the risk of stroke as well as the risk of other stroke risk factors such as diabetes hypertension and dyslipidemia 109 110 There are several limitations to diet studies including recall bias and measurement error but some specific components of diet and nutrition are wellestablished risk factors for stroke Salt intake for example is associated with an increased risk of hypertension and stroke 111115 whereas increased potassium intake is associated with a decreased stroke risk 116119 A Mediterranean diet or a diet high in fruits and vegetables reduces the risk of stroke 120 121

Body weight and obesity are risk factors for stroke although the specific ways in which they increase stroke risk continue to be debated Obesity is related to stroke risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes122 123 A recent large metaanalysis including 18 million participants from 97 cohort studies found that 76 of the effect of body mass index BMI a common measure of obesity on stroke risk was mediated by blood pressure cholesterol and glucose levels Blood pressure alone accounted for 65 of the risk due to weight The importance of distinguishing between increased abdominal adiposity as measured by the waisthip ratio as the major contributor to risk rather than overall increased weight as indicated by the BMI is increasingly recognized124 In INTERSTROKE for example waisttohip ratio was associated with stroke risk though BMI was not 24

The concept of Metabolic Syndrome incorporates obesity dyslipidemia prehypertension and prediabetes There is evidence that a sedentary lifestyle contributes to the Metabolic Syndrome Metabolic Syndrome is prevalent in the United States with approximately 34 of the population meeting the criteria and while it is associated with a clear increase in risk of cardiovascular disease the relationship between Metabolic Syndrome and stroke appears to be increased but not as well described125 The risk of ischemic stroke from metabolic syndrome appears to be double with the risk increasing as the number of components in the syndrome increase126 127 Considering the components of the metabolic syndrome are related to stroke individually the combination of these risk factors should be related to increased stroke risk127

Alcohol consumption substance abuse and smoking The relationship of alcohol consumption to stroke risk depends on stroke type There is evidence of a Jshaped relationship between alcohol consumption and risk of ischemic stroke with light to moderate alcohol consumption up to 2 drinks per day in men and up to one drink per day in women being protective against stroke and heavy drinking associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke 128133 Alcohol consumption has a more direct linear relationship with hemorrhagic stroke such that consumption of even small amounts of alcohol appear to increase risk of hemorrhage Heavy alcohol consumption is linked to hypertension as well as poor blood pressure control in hypertensive patients who consume alcohol 134140
Abuse of illicit substances including cocaine heroin amphetamines and ecstasy is associated with an increased risk of ischemic and hemorrhagic subtypes of strokes 141143 Cigarette smoking remains a major risk factor for stroke nearly doubling the risk with a dose response relationship between packyears and stroke risk 15 144 It is estimated that smoking contributes to nearly 15 of all stroke deaths per year 145 Smoking cessation rapidly reduces the risk of stroke with excess risk nearly disappearing 24 years after smoking cessation 146149 Second hand smoke has been identified as an independent risk factor for stroke in the REGARDS cohort with the risk of stroke increasing 30 after accounting for other stroke risk factors for those who have been exposed to second hand smoke versus those who have not been exposed150

Inflammation and Infection Levels of inflammatory biomarkers have been associated with increased risk of stroke just as they have been associated with risk of other cardiovascular diseases and allcause mortality Creactive protein measured using a highsensitivity assay hsCRP is one marker that has been particularly wellstudied HsCRP has become the inflammatory marker of choice in the clinical setting because of its consistent association with cardiovascular events its long halflife and its stability when stored frozen for prolonged periods of time A metaanalysis of 54 prospective cohort studies including a total of 160309 individuals found a modest association between hsCRP levels and ischemic stroke relative risk per standard deviation increase in the log CRP concentration 127 95 CI 115–140151 Similar results were obtained in a metaanalysis of 12 observational studies of hsCRP and stroke risk152 Genetic studies however have not confirmed a causal association between hsCRP and ischemic stroke risk In one study single nucleotide polymorphisms in the CRP gene were associated with elevations in hsCRP levels but these polymorphisms were not associated with an increase in stroke risk153
The reasons for the association of inflammation with stroke risk remain uncertain Because atherosclerosis is recognized to have a highly inflammatory character with plaque containing high levels of activated macrophages and inflammatory mediators it may be that elevated levels of inflammatory markers reflect a high burden of atherosclerosis or perhaps a highly active form of atherosclerosis Thus elevated inflammatory markers may simply serve as a marker of inflammatory burden from these plaques making elevations in hsCRP a kind of epiphenomenon of vascular disease burden due to other conventional risk factors Observational studies have generally tried to eliminate confounding by these other risk factors through the use of statistical adjustment but the possibility of residual confounding due to the inability to completely measure all such risk factors or their severity remains The genetic studies that have failed to confirm that CRP gene mutations cause an increase in risk would be consistent with possibility of residual confounding There is however some evidence that CRP an acute phase protein may directly contribute to risk of stroke Monomeric CRP for example interacts with other immune mediators to activate platelets and complement proteins154 Functionally each CRP monomeric subunit has a recognition face and an effector face The recognition face can bind to a diverse set of structural groups including phosphocholine residues in the Cpolysaccharide fraction of Streptococcus pneumoniae and apoptotic cells nuclear autoantigens and lipoproteins155 Binding of the recognition face induces a conformational change that allows the effector face to activate the complement pathway by binding to C1q and Fc receptors some of which are found on endothelial cells156 Through this and other mechanisms CRP cytokines and other inflammatory mediators may directly contribute to stroke risk157

One other way in which inflammation may contribute to stroke risk is through infection Recent data suggest that chronic exposure to common infections is a potential risk factor for stroke and that acute infections may also act as triggers for stroke In an analysis from NOMAS for example a composite measure of chronic infection assessed by serologies against several common bacterial and viral infections Chlamydia pneumoniae Helicobacter pylori herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 and cytomegalovirus weighted for the effect of each individual infection on stroke risk was associated with increased longterm stroke risk158 While each individual infection was positively though not significantly associated with stroke risk after adjusting for other risk factors the weighted infectious burden index was associated with an increased risk of all strokes adjusted hazard ratio per standard deviation 139 95 CI 102 – 190 after adjusting for demographics and risk factors Results were similar after adjusting for inflammatory biomarkers This same measure of infectious burden was also associated with carotid plaque thickness and ulceration and with cognitive status and decline159161

Recent studies have also found that Human Immunodeficiency Virus HIV infection is associated with a modest increased risk of both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke even in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy162 163 Mechanisms for this increase in risk remain uncertain but the risk appears to be higher among those with evidence of greater immunosuppression such as lower 200 cellsmm3 CD4 Tcell counts and higher number of HIV1 RNA copies HIV may directly injure the arterial wall There is evidence for example that outward arterial remodeling or relative thinning of the arterial wall occurs more commonly in patients with HIV who have protracted infections and greater viral load prior to death164 Other studies do not suggest a direct effect of immunosuppression on vascular risk though the risk may differ between cardiac and cerebrovascular events165 Other explanations include a higher burden of cardiovascular risk factors among those with HIV infection and adverse metabolic effects of the antiretroviral drugs themselves166

Stroke triggers A new area of investigation in stroke epidemiology involves the determination of stroke triggers Addressing this issue reflects an increasing recognition that while we have a good understanding of the major stroke risk factors the “why me” question our understanding of why strokes occur at a particular point in time the “why now” question remains rudimentary26 Several potential stroke triggers have been identified but recent infection may be one that best lends itself to modification Evidence suggests for instance that acute infections may serve as a shortterm trigger for stroke in patients In a casecrossover analysis from the Cardiovascular Health Study n5888 for example a recent hospitalization for infection was associated with an increased risk of stroke167 In this type of analysis each individual serves as his own control thereby limiting confounding factors and enabling the discovery of timedependent associations Among 669 participants who experienced a stroke the risk of stroke was increased following hospitalization for infection within the previous 90 days odds ratio OR 34 95 CI 1865 The risk increased as the time interval after hospitalization decreased OR 73 95 CI 19409 for a time window of 30 days and OR 80 95 CI 17 773 for a window of 14 days In confirmatory survival analyses hospitalization for an infection was associated with an increased risk of incident ischemic stroke in the following 30 days adjusted HR25 95 CI 1445 The finding that risk increased as shorter time windows were explored indicates that the triggering effects of the hospitalization with infection diminish over time Other evidence suggests that more minor respiratory and urinary tract infections are associated with increased stroke risk and that vaccinations may help prevent stroke A Cochrane review of eight randomized controlled trials with a total of 12029 participants provides evidence that influenza vaccination decreased cardiovascular outcomes and a case series study that used a withinperson method of comparison found that the risk of stroke was increased after respiratory tract infection but was reduced after vaccination against influenza pneumococcal infection and tetanus168169 On the basis of this evidence annual vaccination against influenza may affect stroke rates and could be given to individuals who are at moderate to high risk of stroke as emphasized in recent guidelines
Recent evidence also suggests that severe sepsis is associated with newonset atrial fibrillation thereby increasing risk of stroke170 Research using administrative datasets has identified sepsis as a risk factor for stroke though there may be a low absolute risk of stroke after sepsis and those who are at risk appear to remain at risk for up to a year after their sepsis event It is therefore plausible that acute infectious events lead to a prolonged proinflammatory state that can contribute to stroke risk This phenomenon has been found for the risk of heart failure after pneumonia for example and it may also apply to stroke risk171 172 On the other hand a populationbased cohort study from Denmark showed that about 80 of cardiovascular events after exposure to bacteremia occurred during the index hospitalization with the risk of stroke highest in the first 3 to 15 days post infection167 173 174

The identification of a shortterm state of elevated stroke risk after acute infection could have direct therapeutic implications as well For example increased doses of antiplatelet agents or statins may be warranted during times of fever or infection In addition the period during and soon after hospitalization for infection could constitute a “treatable moment” during which patients can be evaluated for cardiovascular risk and standard preventive strategies instituted

Other potential triggers for stroke include air pollution Air pollution a largely ubiquitous environmental exposure is quickly becoming a widespread public health hazard particularly in urban areas As of 2011 124 million people in the United States were living in areas that did not meet the United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA National Ambient Air Quality Standards Air pollution has been identified as a novel risk factor for stroke Longterm exposure to pollution has been associated with increased risk of stroke175177 Evidence of the relationship between risk of ischemic stroke hospitalization and mortality and shortterm peaks of pollutant levels primarily particulate matter  25 microns in diameter PM25 have been seen primarily in casecrossover and timeseries studies178 A large case crossover study of Medicare beneficiaries in 9 US cities also found that an interquartile range increase in PM10 was associated with a 103 increase in sameday stroke admissions with similar results seen with CO NO2 and SO2179 Longterm exposure over time has generally been shown to increase the risk of a cerebrovascular event180183 though several studies have also reported null associations184 Metaanalyses have found a consistent positive association between air pollution and stroke an analysis of 20 studies identified that exposure to a 5ugm3 increase in PM25 increases the risk of a stroke by 6 and stroke mortality by 125 185

Genetic Risk Factors for Stroke
Hereditary factors contribute to stroke risk although teasing apart risk due to genetic mutations and due to shared familial exposures remains challenging The task has been complicated by the heterogeneity of stroke the multitude of conventional risk factors that cause stroke and the variability among populations and studies Genetic variability may however contribute to stroke risk through several potential mechanisms Table 3 First specific rare single gene disorders may contribute to individual familial syndromes for which stroke is the primary or unique manifestation eg cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy or CADASIL Second single gene disorders may cause a multisystem disorder of which stroke is just one manifestation eg sickle cell anemia Third some common variants of genetic polymorphisms have been associated with stroke risk though the individual contribution of such polymorphisms is regarded as modest eg variants in 9p21186 Fourth genetic causes of conventional stroke risk factors such as atrial fibrillation diabetes and hypertension are also not surprisingly associated with risk of stroke187 Emerging evidence suggests that genetic studies could help to distinguish stroke subtypes and even contribute to patient management For example there is an association between gene variations that confer an increased risk of atrial fibrillation and ischemic stroke This raises the possibility that genetic tests could help to make the diagnosis of strokes likely to be due to atrial fibrillation


Currently heredity is generally considered a nonmodifiable risk factor although genetic therapies may change this in the future Some genetic factors may even be modifiable if not curable already for example those with sickle cell anemia can be treated with exchange transfusion to reduce stroke risk Genetic factors may also be modifiable since environmental factors may also interact with genetic mutations ie geneenvironment interactions thus those with a predisposition to diabetes or hypertension could engage in dietary and other lifestyle modifications to reduce their risk of disease

Heritability of stroke
Recent estimates of heritability using genomewide single nucleotide polymorphism SNP data show similar heritability for cardioembolic 326 and large vessel disease 403 but lower for small vessel disease 161188 Family history of stroke increases stroke risk by 30189 Monozygotic twins are at 165fold higher risk of stroke than dizygotic twins189 Age sex and stroke subtype further affect stroke heritability 64 65 Younger patients are more likely to have a firstdegree relative with stroke64 and women with stroke are more likely to have a parental history of stroke than men65 MRI measures of small vessel ischemic disease however have concordance rates of 061 for monozygotic twins and 038 for dizygotic twins suggesting a genetic susceptibility to small vessel ischemic stroke190

Single gene disorders with stroke as a primary manifestation
CADASIL is a small vessel vasculopathy that affects skin and brain though its clinical manifestations are restricted to the central nervous system The pathology includes degeneration of the media of small vessels and a prominent and progressive leukoencephalopathy Clinically patients present with migrainelike headaches psychiatric complaints including depression and psychosis and recurrent strokes often leading to pseudobulbar palsy and subcortical dementia Characteristic imaging findings include whitematter lesions in the external capsule and anterior temporal poles the imaging findings can usually be distinguished from those of more typical white matter changes associated with hypertension and aging

CADASIL is associated with mutations of the Notch3 gene located on chromosome 19q12191 Most of these are missense mutations altering the number of cysteine residues expressed in an extracellular receptor domain192 Though Notch3 is widely expressed in the body and plays an important role in development CADASIL only affects the nervous system clinically for unknown reasons While the defective receptors usually do not interfere with phenotypic signaling they have been shown to accumulate in the basal lamina of the small arteries193 Skin biopsy revealing granular osmiophilic material can be pathognomonic for the diagnosis sometimes detecting the disease in patients who have relatively minor findings on imaging studies and negative genetic test results for the most common mutations194

Other rare single gene disorders that cause stroke include cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy CARASIL195 caused by mutations in the HtrA serine peptidase1 gene 196 arterial tortuosity syndrome caused by mutations in the SLC2A10 gene encoding a glucose transporter GLUT10197 198 and familial cerebral amyloid angiopathy due to mutations affecting cystatin C199

Single gene multisystem disorders with stroke as an important manifestation
Cerebrovascular complications are wellrecognized in sickle cell anemia SCA and result from polymerized red blood cells at low oxygen tensions leading to small vessel occlusion and sicklerelated arterial disease moyamoya syndrome SCA is seen in approximately 6 of children with stroke but 25 of individuals with SCA will experience a stroke by 45 years of age the highest incidence for ischemic stroke is at 25 years200 Untreated the risk of a recurrent stroke is as high as 90201 Multiple silent infarcts may be more common than clinical infarcts and they can impair cognitive processing and school performance202

Fabry disease is an Xlinked deficiency in αgalactosidase A a lysosomal enzyme caused by both missense and nonsense mutations in the GLA gene Loss of function of αgalactosidase A leads to accumulation of globotriaosylceramide in cells throughout the body including the vascular endothelium Fabry disease is the second most common lysosomal storage disorder Cerebrovascular involvement typically occurs in both large and small vessels especially affecting the posterior circulation and can occur in young stroke patients203 Mechanisms of stroke include cardioembolism from cardiac involvement large artery thromboembolism from dolichoectasia and tortuosity of large vessels and occlusive disease of small vessels due to glycolipid accumulation in the endothelium and vascular smooth muscle cells In the Fabry Outcome Survey the frequency of stroke among males aged 25–44 years was approximately 12 times the expected frequency in the general population204Enzyme replacement therapy can modify the natural course of this disease

The syndrome of mitochondrial encephalopathy lactic acidosis and strokelike episodes MELAS is a mitochondrial disorder caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA leading to respiratory chain failure and reduced energy production The most commonly reported genetic defect is an A3243G substitution within a tRNA gene present in 80 of cases205 The failure of energy production leads to dysfunction and injury of brain tissues from a metabolic cause rather than from an occlusive vascular process thus brain lesions seen in MELAS typically do not observe classic vascular territories Patients present with attacks of encephalopathy and focal neurological dysfunction and may also have migraine headaches nausea and vomiting Episodes may be precipitated by fever which increases metabolic demands Multiple organ systems can be affected leading to short stature hearing loss developmental delay diabetes mellitus and other problems There is significant heterogeneity in the phenotype of family members due to heteroplasmy or the variable expression of mutated mitochondrial DNA within different tissues

Genetic disorders of collagen can also affect multiple tissues including the cerebral vasculature The EhlersDanlos spectrum of disorders represents a group of inherited disorders characterized by connective tissue abnormalities and vascular fragility The most worrisome is EhlersDanlos Type IV which is associated with arterial dissections cerebral aneurysms and stroke Patients may have complications of other organs as well however including uterine rupture during pregnancy Type IV EDS is due to mutations of collagen typeIII COL3A1 Mutations in the gene encoding the alpha1 chain of type IV collagen COL4A1 can also result in impaired vesselwall integrity Cerebrovascular manifestations include smallvessel stenoocclusive disease aneurysms and dolichoectasia with resulting ischemia intracranial hemorrhage leukoencephalopathy and retinal arteriolar tortuosity206 An increased tendency for cerebral hemorrhage can occur with head trauma participation in sports and anticoagulant use207

Other hereditary connective tissue diseases such as Marfan syndrome and ACTA2associated vasculopathy are similarly associated with vascular fragility and can lead to arterial dissections Mutations in the ACTA2 gene encoding actin alpha 2 an isoform of actin found in vascular smoothmuscle leads to actin polymerization and smoothmuscle cell proliferation Phenotypically individuals have evidence of smooth muscle dysfunction throughout the body including fixed dilated pupils hypotonic bladder gut malrotation and hypoperistalsis and pulmonary hypertension208There is a risk for aortic cervical and intracranial arterial dissection209They are also at risk for small vessel disease moyamoya disease and aneurysmal largevessel disease210

Genes associated with common ischemic stroke and stroke risk factors
There is emerging evidence that genetics contribute to the risk of common ischemic stroke Several genetic variants have been identified though the magnitude of effect of each variant is regarded as small Genetic mutations in genes related to coagulation have been extensively investigated MetaStroke is one of the largest genetic collaborations in ischemic stroke and includes 15 European North American and Australian casecontrol stroke cohorts Participants are subtyped by ischemic stroke etiology according to a modified TOAST classification system After detection of potential diseasecausing mutations in initial somewhat smaller European cohorts MetaStroke confirmed an association of stroke with gene variants in the blood type gene ABO rs505922 which is associated with levels of the coagulation proteins von Willebrand Factor and Factor 8 the associations were present for largevessel and cardioembolic stroke subtypes but not for smallvessel disease211

Other subtypespecific genetic variants have been identified Icelandic investigators first reported an association between genetic variants conferring an increased risk of atrial fibrillation and ischemic stroke especially those thought to be cardioembolic Interestingly there was also a significant association in the events classified as noncardiogenic perhaps due to underdiagnosis of atrial fibrillation In a subsequent collaborative analysis among MetaStroke and several other cohorts the PITX2 and ZFHX3 genes were also associated with cardioembolic stroke and the HDAC9 gene and 9p21 locus were associated with largevessel stroke187 In a separate genome wide association study by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke NINDSStroke Genetics Network SiGN project a locus near the TSPAN2 gene on chromosome 1 was also associated with largeartery stroke212 These findings provide insight into the pathophysiology of stroke PITX2 for example encodes a transcriptional activator that is involved in the development of the sinoatrial node and in regulation of ion channels that modulate cardiac conduction ZFHX3 also encodes a transcription factor The HDAC9 gene encodes histone deacetylase though its mechanism for causing atherosclerotic stroke remains uncertain TSPAN2 encodes tetraspanin2 a member of a superfamily of transmembrane proteins that regulate signal transduction and play a role in cell development and growth TSPAN2 is expressed in arterial tissue and blood cells and TSPAN2 knockout mice have activation of microglia and astrocytes

A separate metaanalysis of genomewide association studies including 18 populationbased cohorts with almost 85000 participants n4348 strokes identified a novel locus on chromosome 6p25 rs12204590 near the forkhead transcription factor FOXF2 gene that was associated with both the risk of all strokes and with the white matter hyperintensity burden seen on MRI scans a marker of small vessel disease in a subcohort n21079 individuals213 Deletion of FOXF2 in young patients was associated with extensive white matter disease and mutations in other forkhead transcription factors FOXC1 have been associated with white matter disease syndromes214 Functional experiments in mice confirmed that deletion of Foxf2 is associated with cerebral infarction reactive gliosis and microhemorrhages The zebrafish orthologs of FOXF2 moreover are expressed in brain pericytes and zebrafish without this gene have abnormalities of smooth muscle cell and pericyte coverage of cerebral vessels These data suggest that FOXF2 a transcription factor that plays a role in cerebral vascular wall morphogenesis and function may be a contributor to small vessel disease in humans as well

Much of the research thus far has focused on common genetic variants More recent research however has confirmed that lowfrequency genetic variants ie allele frequency 5 may contribute to risk of large vessel and small vessel stroke215 GUCY1A3 for example a gene that has been associated with early myocardial infarction was associated with large vessel stroke and had an allele frequency in the lead single nucleotide polymorphism SNP of 15 This gene encodes the α1 subunit of soluble guanylyl cyclase which plays a role both in nitric oxide induced vasodilation and platelet inhibition216 Another gene GCH1 also with an allele frequency of only 15 was associated with small vessel stroke GCH1 encodes GTP cyclohydrolase 1 which plays a role in endothelial nitric oxide synthase Thus rare variants may account for some of the unexplained heritability in stroke risk

Variation in chromosome 9p21 has been strongly associated with coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction in multiple cohorts217 Fifteen SNPs in that region were evaluated within large samples from South Germany the UK Europe and North America and six were associated with atherosclerotic or largevessel stroke in adjusted analyses A population attributable risk of 20 for largevessel stroke due to SNPs at 9p21 was estimated from the analysis218

Stroke Prevention
The aim of stroke prevention is to decrease stroke incidence through targeted modification of a single risk factor or a cluster of multiple risk factors employed on a population community or individual level In some cases however as with the use of antiplatelets the goal may be to use an intervention that is known to reduce ischemic stroke risk among those who are deemed to be at elevated risk rather than as a treatment for a specific risk factor There are three broad levels of stroke prevention 1 primordial prevention is the most generalizable and broadly deals with healthy living measures that when applied on a group level aim to decrease the population incidence of physiologic stroke risk factors 2 primary prevention which aims to improve the risk factor profile of individuals who do not have a history of stroke or TIA with the goal of preventing a first cerebrovascular event and 3 secondary prevention which is the most targeted and is only employed after an individual has suffered a stroke or TIA with the goal of preventing stroke recurrence219 220 Figure 2 Examples of primordial stroke prevention include efforts to encourage smoking cessation a healthy diet increased physical activity and weight control Primary and secondary stroke prevention target a person’s specific lifestylerelated and medical stroke risk factors like hypertension and diabetes We will focus this discussion on primordial and primary prevention of ischemic stroke

Levels of stroke prevention in a population

Mass Approaches
The cornerstone of lifetime CVD risk reduction is behavioral modification In primordial prevention healthy lifestyle behaviors such as abstaining from tobacco a healthy diet and regular exercise should start in childhood and continue through one’s lifetime219 221 Prevention efforts targeting behavioral modification are especially well suited for mass interventions such as public health campaigns Though the immediate result is steps removed from the outcome of stroke such campaigns have the potential to affect multiple outcomes including stroke coronary artery disease heart failure diabetes dementia and others222 223 Further these primordial efforts are effective because of the small and widely dispersed magnitude of treatmentrelated adverse events

Recently a more specific form of populationbased cardiovascular prevention has been proposed – the polypill This is an example of a primary prevention effort employed on a mass scale The beststudied is a pill that contains three antihypertensives a hydroxymethylglutarylcoenzyme A HMGCoA reductase inhibitor statin and an antiplatelet agent224 In a phase 2 double–blind randomized controlled clinical trial of healthy adults the polypill was shown to favorably affect blood pressure LDL heart rate and urinary thromboxane B2 level antiplatelet effect when compared to singledrug regimens without increased intolerability Such a formulation could be particularly useful in places where the infrastructure for individualized care is underdeveloped or lacking225 Because stroke incidence has a linear correlation with blood pressure no matter the baseline such standardized methods can be justified226 In an effort to simplify pretherapy serum testing and medical follow up limit sideeffects and ultimately decrease associated cost the minipolypill has recently received attention as a more refined standardized method of community cardiovascular disease prevention The formulation that is being actively studied contains candesartan angiotensinreceptor blocker hydrochlorothiazide thiazide diuretic and a low dose of rosuvastatin The strongest evidence for this approach to mass primary prevention came from The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation HOPE–3 trial a 2by2 factorial design doubleblind placebocontrolled trial in which 12705 participants with intermediate risk of cardiovascular disease but without a history of CVD were assigned to receive either rosuvastatin 10mg  placebo rosuvastatin 10mg  candesartan and HCTZ polypill candesartan and HCTZ  placebo or a double placebo 227230 The analysis that reported the combined therapy with rosuvastatin and the two antihypertensive agents administered versus placebo included 3180 participants in the active arm versus 3168 participants in the control arm The treatment arm was associated with a 14 absolute risk reduction in combined cardiovascular outcomes hazard ratio HR 71 95 CI 056090 half of which was driven by a decrease in stroke incidence Except for an increase in muscle weakness and dizziness the polypill used in this study was well tolerated had a similar compliance rate to placebo and led to fewer hospitalizations for cardiovascular causes This is the first study to validate the efficacy of a mass approach to primary prevention therapy through a standard combination of targeted drug therapies and minimal pretreatment screening Such an effort hinges on the notion that populationwide approaches are effective in reducing outcomes in intermediate and highrisk individuals who may otherwise be naïve to individualized primary prevention efforts The downside of this method is that those in the population who are low risk are also exposed to the side effects of the treatment skewing the risk to benefit ratio Despite this evidence that the polypill approach may be effective in preventing cardiovascular outcomes it is unclear how and where to translate such efforts into clinical practice This is especially true in the United States where access to healthcare varies but is relatively high compared to global standard

Targeted Lifestyle Modification
Physical Activity Classically the lack of standard definitions of exercise intensity and variability in exercise routines along with difficulty measuring the exposure and long time frame needed to see an effect have all made studying the effects of exercise on the outcome of stroke difficult It is now standard to report energy expenditure as metabolic equivalents METs Using this model physical activity is classified as sedentary between 115 METs light between 16 and 29 METs eg playing an activitypromoting video game moderate between 3–59 METs eg ballet dancing and vigorous when 6 MET eg outdoor bicycling231 Based on biological plausibility and evidence from pooled analysis from large prospective cohort and retrospective casecontrol studies it is generally accepted that there is a lifetimelong inverse relationship between physical exercise and stroke223 232 Compared to physically inactive individuals 600 MET minutesweek those who are highly active 8000 MET minutesweek or around 2 hours of daily vigorous activity are estimated to have a 2530 lower risk of stroke223 233 There is also evidence that the there is a gradient in protective effect depending on level of activity although the optimal exercise regimen for specific subsets of the population have not been established234 At this time a generally accepted and useful recommendation for primary stroke prevention which can be tailored to an individual’s lifestyle needs and preference is the AHAACC CVD prevention guideline of at least 40 minutes per day of moderate to vigorous intensity exercise 3 to 4 days per week221 235 Figure 3

Healthy lifestyle related practices for improved cardiovascular health

DASH Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension AHA American Heart Association USDA United States Department of Agriculture122 123

Diet A Cochrane review in 2013 suggested that adherence to a healthy diet can decrease lifetime risk of stroke by nearly 20236 The Mediterranean Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension DASH AHA and US Department of Agriculture USDA food patterns diets are all alike in that they promote a combination of plantderived micro and macronutrients decreased caloric intake related to saturated and trans fats increased intake of fruits and vegetables and decreased salt intake237 The Nurses’ Health Study a prospective cohort of 71768 participants followed dietary patterns from 19841998 It was the first to show that a “Western diet” high in saturated fats processed grains and simple sugars was associated with an increase in stroke incidence RR 158 95 CI 115215 p  0001 while adherence to a “prudent diet” high in fruits and vegetable whole grains legumes and fish was associated with a decreased stroke incidence when comparing extreme quintiles RR 078 95 CI 061101238 Perhaps the strongest evidence in favor of diet reducing cardiovascular events is the Mediterranean diet239 It is defined by high intake of vegetable fruits legumes olive oil as the principal source of fat preferential consumption of fish and poultry over red meat low dairy intake and an option of low intake of red wine240 The Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet PREDIMED study a multicenter randomized trial that compared the effects of the Mediterranean diet on cardiovascular outcomes found an approximate 30 95 CI 046098 P004 reduction of stroke incidence for a Mediterranean diet high in olive oil compared to a standard low fat diet and a 50 95 CI 035084 P0006 reduction for a Mediterranean diet high in mixed nuts241 Similar to the Mediterranean diet a metaanalysis showed that the DASH diet was associated with a nearly 20 lowered risk of stroke 95 CI 072 092242 In general any diet that revolves around the high intake of plantbased nutrients low salt and curbing of saturated fats and simple sugars such as the Mediterranean DASH USDA food patterns or AHA diets are recommended for the purpose of good cardiovascular health and primary stroke prevention It may also be reasonable to supplement any of these diets with a high intake of mixed nuts defined by 6 weekly servings of 30 g of mixed nuts 241
Smoking cessation Among smokers cessation leads to a decrease in stroke risk to levels similar to nonsmokers by 5 years243 The US Public Health Service Clinical Practice Guidelines Executive Summary recommends physicianled screening counseling and referral to further behavior support of those who smoke as well as the routine use of nicotine replacement products bupropion and varenicline in those who are seeking to quit smoking  unless medically contraindicated244 Although the benefits are likely to far outweigh the risk of therapy the FDA has advised careful monitoring of patients on varenicline based on three systematic reviews suggesting an increased risk of cardiovascular events including stroke in patients treated with varenicline compared to placebo For the purpose of cardiovascular disease prevention it is reasonable to use a combination of behavior therapy nicotine replacement andor bupropion and varenicline with close monitoring of high risk patients on varenicline245
Targeted Risk Factor Modification
Hypertension A metaanalysis of 147 trials including 464000 participants without a history of vascular disease or stroke found that blood pressure reductions of 10 mm Hg systolic or 5 mm Hg diastolic were associated with a 40 percent reduction in stroke risk 60 The effect is present even at levels below those thought to be normotensive and down to 110 mm Hg systolic and 60 mm Hg diastolic 226 246 The disproportionately high prevalence of hypertension and diabetes among American blacks is likely a major driver of their higher rates of stroke Further blacks are more likely to suffer from increased blood pressure variability and are less likely to be adequately treated all poor prognostic factors in the development of blood pressurerelated morbidity61 Beta blockers thiazide diuretics angiotensinconvertingenzyme inhibitors angiotensin receptor blockers and calcium channel blockers are the most widely studied agents and while there are are some class differences the majority of benefit is conferred by the level of blood pressure control rather than the class of medication used247
AHAACC guidelines recommend regular blood pressure screening and promotion of lifestyle modification for patients found to have prehypertension defined as systolic blood pressure of 120 to 139 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure of 80 to 89 mm Hg248 In hypertensive patients blood pressure goals for the purpose of primary stroke prevention can generally be adapted from the recommendations from the Eighth Joint National Committee JNC8 guidelines for blood pressure management For individuals younger than 60 who are hypertensive defined as a blood pressure 140 mm Hg systolic or 90 mm Hg diastolic medical therapy is indicated For those older than 60 who do not have a history of diabetes or kidney failure the JNC8 guidelines call for a more liberal target of 15090 mm Hg249 The different recommendation based on age is countered however by a recent large randomized control trial that included 9361 persons who were 50 years of age or older and with a systolic blood pressure of 130 mm Hg or higher Intensive treatment targets of 120 mm Hg systolic compared to standard treatment of 140 mm Hg reduced the risk of composite cardiovascular outcomes HR 075 95 CI 064089 p0001 and showed a trend toward reduced stroke risk HR 089 95 CI 063125 Adverse events were not significantly different between the two groups and the benefits extended out to those older than 75250 For the purpose of primary stroke prevention lifestyle modification and pharmacological therapy should be combined to achieve strict blood pressure goals less than 14090 mm Hg While the effects on stroke prevention are still unproven it may be reasonable to target systolic blood pressure goals 120 mm Hg in individuals who are at low risk for complications from antihypertensive therapy Selfmeasured blood pressure monitoring devices are also recommended to better gauge treatment effects limit adverse effects and optimize blood pressure control248

Diabetes Aggressive management of hyperglycemia in diabetics has not been shown to decrease the incidence of stroke and may actually be harmful The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes Study ACCORD compared intensive glucose lowering to a goal glycated hemoglobin HgbA1C level below 6 versus liberalized goals of 7  79 and found no difference in stroke incidence but a statistically significant increase in overall mortality in the intensive management group The results suggest that it may be that the greatest effects of hyperglycemia on stroke risk accumulate early in the course of the disease and in the prediabetes stage rather than late in the course when comorbid cardiovascular risk factors are more likely to be present This notion is supported by a recent randomized controlled trial of pioglitazone used after stroke or TIA in those with prediabetes 251 It enrolled 3876 individuals after a recent stroke or TIA who also had prediabetes The combined outcome of recurrent stroke and myocardial infarction was seen in 90 of the pioglitazone group and 118 of the placebo group HR 076 95 CI 062093 over a nearly 5 year period of follow up Importantly there was also corresponding 52 reduction in incidence of diabetes Unfortunately treatment with pioglitazone resulted in a greater frequency of weight gain edema and bone fracture limiting its practical utility The 2016 recommendation by the American Diabetes Association calls for HgbA1C targets of less than 7 for the purpose of preventing cardiovascular complications of diabetes It may be reasonable to liberalize the HgbA1C goal to 8 in the elderly or frail252 At this time the presence of prediabetes necessitates intensive lifestyle intervention while targeted medical pharmacological therapy with metformin for example may be optimal for certain individuals253
Hyperlipidemia The role of cholesterol reduction particularly with HMGCoA reductase inhibitors or statins has been demonstrated in several observational studies and clinical trials Large epidemiological studies like the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial MRFIT which included over 350000 men have shown a positive association between increased cholesterol levels and stroke mortality In primary stroke prevention trials several statins have been associated with reductions in risk of stroke ranging from 1140 The Heart Protection Study HPS a randomized multicenter placebocontrolled trial of simvastatin therapy that included 20536 individuals with either coronary artery disease peripheral vascular disease or diabetes showed a 5year stroke risk reduction of 25 in the simvastatin group compared to placebo p00001254 The effect was driven by the decrease in ischemic strokes without an increase in risk of hemorrhagic strokes Importantly these benefits remained in those with LDL less than 100 mgdL More aggressive treatment was associated with a further reduction in risk In the Treating to New Targets TNT study compared to atorvastatin 10 mg daily atorvastatin 80 mg daily was associated with a 25 reduction in stroke risk that correlated with reductions in LDL Furthermore metaanalyses of lipid therapy and stroke showed that with each 1 mmolL reduction in LDL cholesterol there was an approximate 20 relative risk reduction in ischemic stroke 255 256
The role for statin therapy in stroke prevention is also evident in secondary prevention studies A posthoc analysis of HPS showed that in patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease without coronary disease n3280 simvastatin was associated with a 5 reduction in the risk of major cardiovascular events or death compared to placebo257 The Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels SPARCL trial however provides the most direct evidence regarding the role of statins in stroke patients Patients n4731 with stroke or TIA and baseline LDL 100190 mgdL were randomized to atorvastatin 80 mg versus placebo beginning 16 months after their event Atorvastatin was associated with an approximate 2 absolute reduction in recurrent stroke risk 131 vs 112 over a median follow up of 5 years with a relative risk reduction of 16258 The benefits of statins on risk reduction were similar across subtypes of the index stroke subtype as well implying that all ischemic stroke patients regardless of subtype should receive statin therapy259 While there was a 09 absolute increase in risk of hemorrhagic stroke among patients on atorvastatin 23 at 5 years compared to placebo 14 hazard ratio 166 95 CI 108 to 255 this detrimental effect was more than outweighed by the effect on ischemic stroke which occurred much more commonly such that the benefits overall favored atorvastatin for total stroke prevention 112 on atorvastatin versus 131 on placebo

While SPARCL was the first clinical trial to prove the benefit of high dose statin therapy in secondary stroke prevention the effect was modest with a number needed to treat of 50 over 5 years There were several limitations moreover For instance patients were eligible for randomization beginning one month after stroke a period where the risk of stroke recurrence falls especially in patients with large artery atherosclerosis in whom statins may provide the most stroke prevention benefit Ongoing trials are addressing the role of statin therapy given immediately after stroke not only to reduce lipid levels and prevent recurrent stroke but also to ameliorate cerebral injury related to the stroke itself For example the Neuroprotection with Statin Therapy for Acute Recovery NeuSTART trial is a Phase II trial randomizing patients with acute ischemic stroke to lovastatin 640 mg daily for three days versus placebo to determine the safety and efficacy of lovastatin in reducing infarct size and promoting stroke recovery which may be a function of the pleiotropic effects of statins260 In addition SPARCL did not establish a target LDL

Beyond the primary effect of statins on lowering levels of LDL there is evidence that they may also improve endothelial function and attenuate inflammation In one large trial in which healthy individuals with normal LDL levels and mildly elevated hsCRP levels received highdose rosuvastatin or a placebo after a 2 year follow up period the rate of stroke was 48 lower in the treatment group than in the placebo group absolute risk reduction of 016261 The additional reduction in risk of other cardiovascular outcomes could provide a rationale for the use of rosuvastatin for primary prevention in patients with elevated hsCRP levels but normal lipid levels Furthermore the absolute reduction in risk was greatest among those with the highest levels of hsCRP reflecting the fact that these patients were at higher risk of cardiovascular events overall

Antiplatelet therapies Unlike in secondary stroke prevention where a large body of evidence supports the role for antiplatelet therapy in preventing recurrent stroke there is little evidence to recommend the use of antiplatelet therapy for sole purpose of primary stroke prevention A metaanalysis of vascular events in six primary prevention trials that included 95000 individuals contributing 660000 personyears done by the Antithrombotic Trialists’ Collaboration in 2009 showed no overall effect of aspirin on stroke incidence 020 vs 021 per year p04262 The 2015 guidelines from the US Preventive Services Task Force on aspirin use for primary CVD prevention can be applied to primary prevention of stroke They recommend aspirin use for primary CVD prevention only in high risk individuals aged 5059 263 There is no convincing evidence for the use of dual antiplatelet therapies such as aspirin and clopidogrel combined for primary stroke prevention264 In the Clopidogrel and Aspirin versus Aspirin Alone for the Prevention of Atherothrombotic Events CHARISMA trial for example 15603 patients with cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors were randomized to aspirin 75162 mg daily alone or in combination with clopidogrel 75 mg daily and followed for 28 months The primary endpoint was a composite myocardial infarction stroke or vascular death There was no statistical difference in outcome between those in the dual antiplatelet group 68 versus those taking aspirin alone 73 p022 The risk of bleeding was higher on dual antiplatelets however
Atrial fibrillation and heart failure Warfarin a vitamin K antagonist VKA has been for many years the standard therapy for both primary and secondary stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular AF In primary prevention the AFASAK trial was the first to compare warfarin to aspirin or placebo in patients with chronic AF and showed a significant reduction in stroke risk with warfarin265 The Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation Study SPAF a doubleblind placebocontrolled trial comparing warfarin aspirin and placebo in patients without a history of stroke also showed significant benefit with warfarin and a relative risk reduction of 76 absolute risk reduction of 51 when compared to placebo266 There was also a reduced risk of stroke incidence when warfarin was compared to aspirin albeit less than when compared to placebo
Since those trials there have been advances in thromboembolism prevention with the addition of a number novel anticoagulants from two separate classes Dabigatran a direct thrombin inhibitor and edoxaban rivaroxaban and apixaban all factor Xa inhibitors were shown to be noninferior in efficacy to warfarin in reducing strokes in patients with AF267270 The rates of major hemorrhage have also been compared between the new agents and warfarin in a metaanalysis that included 102607 patients The novel agents as a group were associated with a lower risk of major hemorrhage RR 072 p 001 including ICH RR 053 p  001 without any difference in risk of gastrointestinal bleeding The incidence of ICH was 051 in the novel agents group and 108 in the warfarin group271

To assist with clinical decision making validated AF scoring systems such as CHADS2 or the newer CHA2DS2VASc score can be used to approximate ischemic stroke event rates from underlying AF272 273 Depending on the scoring system used a number of comorbid conditions act as additional predictors of stroke risk Tables 4 and ​and55 For both scoring systems anticoagulation is generally recommended for those with scores of 2 or higher

A new alternative to anticoagulation for patients with AF is left atrial appendage closure Because an estimated 90 of thromboembolic material originates in the atrial appendage in patients with nonrheumatic AF274 closing the atrial appendage was theorized as a way to prevent AFrelated thromboembolism The two ways to achieve atrial appendage closure and make it functionally obsolete are through surgical ligation and through a transaortic catheter approach using the Watchman or Amplatzer transaortic devices275 276 Patients are generally expected to be on therapeutic doses of warfarin for at least 45 days after a closure procedure followed by 6 months of dual antiplatelet therapy and indefinite aspirin use There is a small subset of patients in whom there has been inadequate seeding of the device necessitating a longer course of anticoagulation Two randomized controlled trials compared the Watchman device to warfarin in patients with nonvalvular AF the PROTECTAF Watchman Left Atrial Appendage System for Embolic Protection in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation and the more recent PREVAIL Prospective Randomized Evaluation of the Watchman Left Atrial Appendage Closure device in patients with atrial fibrillation versus longterm warfarin therapy trials In both trials the Watchman device was noninferior in efficacy for the prevention of ischemic stroke277 278 Pericardial effusion periprocedural stroke and device embolization accounted for the major complications Based on these two studies the Watchman device was approved by the FDA for use in patients who a have nonvalvular AF b carry an increased risk of stroke c are indicated for and may take warfarin and d have a reason to seek a nondrug alternative to anticoagulation279

The Warfarin and Aspirin in Patients with Heart Failure and Sinus Rhythm WARCEF study evaluated the role of anticoagulation with warfarin versus aspirin for the prevention of ischemic stroke intracerebral hemorrhage or death in patients with congestive heart failure and an ejection fraction EF 35280 It included 2305 participants with a mean EF of 27 followed for up to 6 years There was no difference in the composite outcome 264 vs 275 HR 093 95 CI 079110 p04 but there was a reduction in ischemic stroke 25 vs 47 HR 052 95 CI 033082 p0005 with no increase in ICH Further accounting for time on treatment there was a marginal benefit of warfarin over aspirin by the 4th year of follow up but there was also higher rate of major systemic hemorrhage mostly gastrointestinal hemorrhage with warfarin The study concluded that a reduced risk of ischemic stroke with anticoagulation was offset by an increased risk of major hemorrhage A secondary analysis showed that increasing the time that patients are in the therapeutic range with warfarin was significantly associated with better outcomes and improved net clinical benefit281 Based on a metaanalysis that included 3663 patients there is no clear evidence at this time to recommend the use of anticoagulation in this subgroup of patients282 With the availability of newer oral anticoagulants with a more favorable risk profile however it is possible that future trials could demonstrate a benefit

Extracranial and intracranial atherosclerotic disease Another major source of preventable cerebral infarction is large vessel atherosclerotic disease and specifically internal carotid artery stenosis In asymptomatic ie those without a history of recent stroke or TIA on the side of the stenosis men with greater than 60 carotid stenosis and low perioperative risk carotid endarterectomy CEA was shown beneficial approximately 20 procedures must be performed to prevent one stroke over a five year period There is no clear benefit in women or those with a perioperative risk of 3283 284 There is no benefit of CEA in asymptomatic patients with less than 50 stenosis285286
For patients with symptomatic extracranial carotid stenosis of at least 70 ie those with stroke or TIA and a stenosis on the symptomatic side there is evidence that CEA reduces the risk of stroke by 50 in relative terms with an absolute risk reduction of about 13 over two years 287 The studies that demonstrated a benefit of surgical revascularization were conducted 1025 years ago however Since the advent of more aggressive medical approaches to atherosclerotic disease particularly statins there have been temporal changes in the rates of stroke among medicallytreated patients with atherosclerotic carotid artery disease Stroke rates among medicallytreated patients were significantly lower in studies that completed recruitment after 2000 113 per year than in those that completed recruitment earlier 238 per year P  0001288 More recent studies eg the Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy Versus Stenting Trial 2 are ongoing289

For patients with asymptomatic intracranial stenosis there is no evidence of benefit to stenting or angioplasty Even for those with symptomatic intracranial stenosis recent trials do not provide any evidence of a benefit to stenting intracranial arteries of 50 stenosis or greater The Comparison of Warfarin and Aspirin for Symptomatic Intracranial Stenosis WASID trial studied aspirin versus warfarin in patients with symptomatic intracranial stenosis of 5099 It was stopped early because of a high rate of adverse events in the warfarin group leading to a conclusion that warfarin does not provide a benefit over aspirin and may even be harmful in this subset of patients The subsequent Stenting Versus Aggressive Medical Management of Intracranial Atherosclerotic Stenosis SAMMPRIS trial enrolled patients with symptomatic highgrade intracranial stenosis 70 comparing percutaneous stenting to best medical management with aggressive risk factor control and dual antiplatelet therapy for three months290 During a median follow up of 32 months the primary endpoint of recurrent stroke or death was seen in 23 of the stenting group and 15 in the medical management group 291 Interestingly the medical group had a lowerthanexpected recurrence of stroke compared to that which was predicted from previous studies The results suggested that aggressive medical therapy is superior to intervention for high grade intracranial stenosis with currently available technology particularly in the context of current medical approaches as was seen with extracranial disease as noted above as well

Conclusion
Recent years have witnessed tremendous strides in in our understanding of risk factors and prevention of stroke Research into stroke risk factors has increasingly addressed the heterogeneous subtypes of strokes including not only hemorrhagic versus ischemic stroke but also the several etiologic subtypes of stroke Thus studies have confirmed that lipids are a risk factor for atherosclerotic stroke while atrial fibrillation and related atrial cardiopathies are associated with cardioembolic strokes Genetic analyses have benefited in particular from the emphasis on specific categories of stroke Mutations in particular genes have now been associated with and replicated in large vessel cardioembolic and small vessel stroke subtypes Genetic studies have also suggested new avenues to pursue in teasing out stroke pathogenesis These studies suggest that in the future precision medicine will enable clinicians to better focus treatments in cerebrovascular disease Meanwhile several large clinical trials have provided evidence of the benefits of several medical and behavioral treatments in reducing stroke risk Blood pressure reduction statin therapy antiplatelets anticoagulants carotid revascularization and dietary changes have all been proven to reduce stroke risk in various patient populations Just as importantly some treatments such as stenting of stenosed intracranial vessels have not yet been proven of benefit Observational studies provide strong evidence for other behavioral approaches including smoking cessation and regular physical activity Considerations of alternative approaches to prevention in general such as the mass approach using therapies like the polypill utilizing risk estimation in primary care and focusing on highrisk intervals of time after stroke triggers also have the potential to dramatically change the future of stroke prevention

Symptoms
If you or someone youre with may be having a stroke pay particular attention to the time the symptoms began Some treatment options are most effective when given soon after a stroke begins

Signs and symptoms of stroke include

Trouble speaking and understanding what others are saying You may experience confusion slur words or have difficulty understanding speech
Paralysis or numbness of the face arm or leg You may develop sudden numbness weakness or paralysis in the face arm or leg This often affects just one side of the body Try to raise both your arms over your head at the same time If one arm begins to fall you may be having a stroke Also one side of your mouth may droop when you try to smile
Problems seeing in one or both eyes You may suddenly have blurred or blackened vision in one or both eyes or you may see double
Headache A sudden severe headache which may be accompanied by vomiting dizziness or altered consciousness may indicate that youre having a stroke
Trouble walking You may stumble or lose your balance You may also have sudden dizziness or a loss of coordination
When to see a doctor
Seek immediate medical attention if you notice any signs or symptoms of a stroke even if they seem to come and go or they disappear completely Think FAST and do the following

Face Ask the person to smile Does one side of the face droop
Arms Ask the person to raise both arms Does one arm drift downward Or is one arm unable to rise
Speech Ask the person to repeat a simple phrase Is his or her speech slurred or strange
Time If you observe any of these signs call 911 or emergency medical help immediately
Call 911 or your local emergency number right away Dont wait to see if symptoms stop Every minute counts The longer a stroke goes untreated the greater the potential for brain damage and disability

If youre with someone you suspect is having a stroke watch the person carefully while waiting for emergency assistance

Causes
There are two main causes of stroke a blocked artery ischemic stroke or leaking or bursting of a blood vessel hemorrhagic stroke Some people may have only a temporary disruption of blood flow to the brain known as a transient ischemic attack TIA that doesnt cause lasting symptoms

Enlarge image
This is the most common type of stroke It happens when the brains blood vessels become narrowed or blocked causing severely reduced blood flow ischemia Blocked or narrowed blood vessels are caused by fatty deposits that build up in blood vessels or by blood clots or other debris that travel through the bloodstream most often from the heart and lodge in the blood vessels in the brain

Some initial research shows that COVID19 infection may increase the risk of ischemic stroke but more study is needed

Hemorrhagic stroke
Hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in the brain leaks or ruptures Brain hemorrhages can result from many conditions that affect the blood vessels Factors related to hemorrhagic stroke include

Uncontrolled high blood pressure
Overtreatment with blood thinners anticoagulants
Bulges at weak spots in your blood vessel walls aneurysms
Trauma such as a car accident
Protein deposits in blood vessel walls that lead to weakness in the vessel wall cerebral amyloid angiopathy
Ischemic stroke leading to hemorrhage
A less common cause of bleeding in the brain is the rupture of an irregular tangle of thinwalled blood vessels arteriovenous malformation

Transient ischemic attack TIA
A transient ischemic attack TIA — sometimes known as a ministroke — is a temporary period of symptoms similar to those in a stroke A TIA doesnt cause permanent damage A TIA is caused by a temporary decrease in blood supply to part of the brain which may last as little as five minutes

Like an ischemic stroke a TIA occurs when a clot or debris reduces or blocks blood flow to part of the nervous system

Seek emergency care even if you think youve had a TIA because your symptoms got better Its not possible to tell if youre having a stroke or TIA based only on the symptoms If youve had a TIA it means you may have a partially blocked or narrowed artery leading to the brain Having a TIA increases your risk of having a fullblown stroke later

Risk factors
Many factors can increase the risk of stroke Potentially treatable stroke risk factors include
Lifestyle risk factors
Being overweight or obese
Physical inactivity
Heavy or binge drinking
Use of illegal drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine
Medical risk factors
High blood pressure
Cigarette smoking or secondhand smoke exposure
High cholesterol
Diabetes
Obstructive sleep apnea
Cardiovascular disease including heart failure heart defects heart infection or irregular heart rhythm such as atrial fibrillation
Personal or family history of stroke heart attack or transient ischemic attack
COVID19 infection
Other factors associated with a higher risk of stroke include

Age — People age 55 or older have a higher risk of stroke than do younger people
Race or ethnicity — African Americans and Hispanics have a higher risk of stroke than do people of other races or ethnicities
Sex — Men have a higher risk of stroke than do women Women are usually older when they have strokes and theyre more likely to die of strokes than are men
Hormones — Use of birth control pills or hormone therapies that include estrogen increases risk
Complications
A stroke can sometimes cause temporary or permanent disabilities depending on how long the brain lacks blood flow and which part is affected Complications may include

Paralysis or loss of muscle movement You may become paralyzed on one side of the body or lose control of certain muscles such as those on one side of the face or one arm
Difficulty talking or swallowing A stroke might affect control of the muscles in the mouth and throat making it difficult for you to talk clearly swallow or eat You also may have difficulty with language including speaking or understanding speech reading or writing
Memory loss or thinking difficulties Many people who have had strokes experience some memory loss Others may have difficulty thinking reasoning making judgments and understanding concepts
Emotional problems People who have had strokes may have more difficulty controlling their emotions or they may develop depression
Pain Pain numbness or other unusual sensations may occur in the parts of the body affected by stroke For example if a stroke causes you to lose feeling in the left arm you may develop an uncomfortable tingling sensation in that arm
Changes in behavior and selfcare ability People who have had strokes may become more withdrawn They may need help with grooming and daily chores
Prevention
Knowing your stroke risk factors following your health care providers recommendations and adopting a healthy lifestyle are the best steps you can take to prevent a stroke If youve had a stroke or a transient ischemic attack TIA these measures might help prevent another stroke The followup care you receive in the hospital and afterward also may play a role

Many stroke prevention strategies are the same as strategies to prevent heart disease In general healthy lifestyle recommendations include

Controlling high blood pressure hypertension This is one of the most important things you can do to reduce your stroke risk If youve had a stroke lowering your blood pressure can help prevent a subsequent TIA or stroke Healthy lifestyle changes and medications are often used to treat high blood pressure
Lowering the amount of cholesterol and saturated fat in your diet Eating less cholesterol and fat especially saturated fat and trans fats may reduce buildup in the arteries If you cant control your cholesterol through dietary changes alone your doctor may prescribe a cholesterollowering medication
Quitting tobacco use Smoking raises the risk of stroke for smokers and nonsmokers exposed to secondhand smoke Quitting tobacco use reduces the risk of stroke
Managing diabetes Diet exercise and losing weight can help you keep your blood sugar in a healthy range If lifestyle factors dont seem to be enough to control your diabetes your doctor may prescribe diabetes medication
Maintaining a healthy weight Being overweight contributes to other stroke risk factors such as high blood pressure cardiovascular disease and diabetes
Eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables A diet containing five or more daily servings of fruits or vegetables may reduce the risk of stroke The Mediterranean diet which emphasizes olive oil fruit nuts vegetables and whole grains may be helpful
Exercising regularly Aerobic exercise reduces the risk of stroke in many ways Exercise can lower blood pressure increase the levels of good cholesterol and improve the overall health of the blood vessels and heart It also helps you lose weight control diabetes and reduce stress Gradually work up to at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity — such as walking jogging swimming or bicycling — on most if not all days of the week
Drinking alcohol in moderation if at all Heavy alcohol consumption increases the risk of high blood pressure ischemic strokes and hemorrhagic strokes Alcohol may also interact with other drugs youre taking However drinking small to moderate amounts of alcohol such as one drink a day may help prevent ischemic stroke and decrease the bloods clotting tendency Talk to your doctor about whats appropriate for you
Treating obstructive sleep apnea OSA Your doctor may recommend a sleep study if you have symptoms of OSA — a sleep disorder that causes you to stop breathing for short periods repeatedly during sleep Treatment for OSA includes a device that delivers positive airway pressure through a mask to keep the airway open while you sleep
Avoiding illegal drugs Certain street drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine are established risk factors for a TIA or a stroke
Preventive medications
If youve had an ischemic stroke or a TIA your doctor may recommend medications to help reduce your risk of having another stroke These include

Antiplatelet drugs Platelets are cells in the blood that form clots Antiplatelet drugs make these cells less sticky and less likely to clot The most commonly used antiplatelet medication is aspirin Your doctor can help you determine the right dose of aspirin for you

After a TIA or minor stroke your doctor may give you aspirin and an antiplatelet drug such as clopidogrel Plavix for a period of time to reduce the risk of another stroke If you cant take aspirin your doctor may prescribe clopidogrel alone

Anticoagulants These drugs reduce blood clotting Heparin is fast acting and may be used shortterm in the hospital

Sloweracting warfarin Jantoven may be used over a longer term Warfarin is a powerful bloodthinning drug so youll need to take it exactly as directed and watch for side effects Youll also need to have regular blood tests to monitor warfarins effects

Several newer bloodthinning medications anticoagulants are available for preventing strokes in people who have a high risk These medications include dabigatran Pradaxa rivaroxaban Xarelto apixaban Eliquis and edoxaban Savaysa Theyre shorter acting than warfarin and usually dont require regular blood tests or monitoring by your doctor These drugs are also associated with a lower risk of bleeding complications compared to warfarin
